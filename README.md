# WalletConnect CDN Example

Using your compatible wallet like Trust Wallet to connect to your DApp by using WalletConnect CDN packages.

## Usage

Download and open the `index.html` file in your browser or serve it (i.e. `python -m http.server`).

## Dev notes

Using `@walletconnect/browser` and `@walletconnect/qrcode-modal` for wallet operations. And the `https://ethereum-api.xyz` API for retriving data from the blockchain using the `axios` package.

Using a base64 image to enable loading everything from the html file.
